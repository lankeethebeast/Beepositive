# Bee Positive: UK Biodiversity Analysis

## Overview
Bee Positive is a project dedicated to analyzing UK biodiversity trends, specifically focusing on pollinator decline and its relationship with environmental factors. Using machine learning and data analysis, the project aims to identify patterns and predict future trends based on historical data (1992-2022).

## Key Features
- **Data Integration**: Merges multiple UK biodiversity indicator datasets including:
  - Agri-environment schemes
  - Habitat connectivity
  - Insects of the wider countryside
  - Plants of the wider countryside
  - Pollinating insects
- **Machine Learning Analysis**: Includes supervised models for predicting decline and unsupervised clustering for species trends.
- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Implements AI-driven optimization for data cleaning and missing value handling.

## Project Structure
- `BeePositive_ML_Analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the data science workflow.
- `BeePositive_Merged_Data_1992_2022.csv`: Unified dataset used for modeling.
- `BeePositive_Academic_Report.pdf`: Comprehensive documentation of the research findings.

## Data Sources
The data is sourced from UK Biodiversity Indicators (UK-BDI) reports, covering various aspects of ecosystem health and species diversity.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook and the required Python libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.) installed.
3. Open `BeePositive_ML_Analysis.ipynb` to view the analysis.
